When uploading images, specify name of the file you would like to create to store the photos (the listing number of the property that you 
intend to insert). You can then go search for and upload an image for that property. Click Upload. If you intend to upload a further image, you must
again specify the file that you would like this additional image stored in (again, this will be the listing number for the property). From 
here, you can select an image and click Upload. You can then proceed to insert the rest of the details about the property and upload it.

to a page displaying all of the properties within that price range, in tabular form.
